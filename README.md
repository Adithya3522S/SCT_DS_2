Titanic Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

📖 About

This script was developed as Task 2 during my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.

The workflow includes:

Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)

Cleaning the dataset for analysis

Visualizing survival trends with respect to:

Gender

Age

Passenger Class

Correlated features

Each visualization includes:

Proper legends and titles

Kaggle dataset source annotation
